# Hi, my name is Roberto Farfan


### Software Developer

I am a mechatronic engineer with experience as Software Developer. 

In 2015 I started my studies in mechatronics and during my second semester I learned C++ and Java. 

On my university way I developed various electromechanic projets (my old teachers would sais "mechatronics projects").Programming languages were a very important tools for achieve the projects; the microcontrollers are coding in C and C++; most often my teachers required me to implement GUIs, for show measurements from sensors, controll robotic arms, graph measuremtns or turn on/turn off the project. Java was very usefull. 

I finished a thesis in the middle of a pandemic and I noticed the importance and potential of coding so I learned Python and how to design Databases. I started my professional career as a Freelance and I have experience developing applications on Python.
